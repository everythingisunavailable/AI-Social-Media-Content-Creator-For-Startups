# AI Social Media Content Generator for Startups

Web app where startups post their product information and then an AI summarization caption is created for each post combined with an image that is generated by an AI or even chosen by an AI from an existing database. Then the post is shared in the selected social media by using their respective API-s.

## Workflow Example (made with AI)

1. User visits the web app and logs in using Google OAuth.
2. After login, the user is redirected to their dashboard.

3. User clicks “Create New Post”.

4. User fills in the product details form:
   - Product Name
   - Product Description
   - Tone of Voice (e.g. Friendly, Professional)
   - Target Platform (e.g. Instagram)

5. User clicks “Generate Content”.

6. Backend calls AI services:
   - AI generates a caption using GPT.
   - AI generates or selects an image.

7. User is shown a Preview Screen:
   - Caption (editable)
   - Image (regenerate or replace option)

8. User clicks “Continue” to proceed.

9. If not connected, user connects their social media account (Instagram OAuth).

10. User chooses:
    - Post Now
    - or Schedule Post (choose date/time)
